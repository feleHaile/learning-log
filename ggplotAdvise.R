# 1) put your data frame in order; 
# 2) set up a basic plot with the qplot or ggplot function; 
# 3) add one extra geom at at time (optional if you make a simple plot 
#                                   with qplot, since qplot sets up the first 
#                                   geometry for you); 
# 4) add the settings needed to make the plot look good.
